/*Usefulness
Type Safety: By defining these interfaces and types, the TypeScript compiler can catch type-related errors at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
Consistency: Ensures that the structure of request bodies and other data structures is consistent throughout the application.
Documentation: Serves as an in-code documentation, making it clear what the expected shape of the data is for different operations.
IntelliSense: Improves developer experience by providing IntelliSense support in code editors, which helps in writing and refactoring code.*/
